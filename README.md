# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Tree-of-lower-value
A Genetic Algorithm for finding a directed tree (with a set o vertices included) of lower weight.


Trabalho de Otimização Combinatória - 2018/2 - UFRGS


Instance:
A directed graph G = (V, A)  with weights Wa,  a vertex v ∈ V,  
and a set of vertex R ⊆ V with r ∈ R.

Solution:
A directed tree T = (Vt, At) with root r which contains all vertex
in R (and probably others), R ⊆ Vt.

Objective:
Minimize the sum of all Wa in T.
